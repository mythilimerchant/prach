      <br>Dearest Prachi,
      <br><br>Happy sixteenth birthday to you. This is a very special day and I am overjoyed to see you reach this milestone. It is especially important as you are just emerging from one of the roughest patches in your life. It is great to see you coming out fighting like AB Devilliers :-) for RCB.
      <br><br>So, you enter a new phase in your life and it is great to see you start it with gusto and enthusiasm. Your enthusiasm is infectious and I love being part of it. Whether it is RCB, Rachel, traveling, music, mandala art or seeing "Friends". As we recently saw in your baby videos, when you and I were playing "Hi Ho Cheerios", every little thing and joy in your life magnifies not just for yourself but also for those around us. I especially remember how we would literally fall on the floor from the sofas, laughing, when we saw "De Dana Dan" or "Malamaal Weekly".
      <br><br>You love your junk foods, french fries and lays chips. There are so many happy moments when I got you your chips on the sly and I got a wonderful smile from you that lit up my heart. Hope we have plenty of such moments more, but, with healthy foods ;-) Now is the time to cut back on junk and move to healthy foods. 
      <br><br>I want to wish you the very best in the coming years. I am always there for you. I just want to have more fun, and an open, friendly and fun relationship between us. Wishing you lots of new adventures and fun. And as you do that don't forget, that there is still lets of good work to be done, mountains to be conquered. Just like RCB, the trophy has still to be won.
      <br><br>Love 
      <br>Papa
