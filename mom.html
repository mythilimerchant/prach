      My Dearest Prachi,
      <br><br>Wish you many many happy returns of the day. Stay blessed and have a great year ahead. May God bless you and give you all what you deserve and more!!
      <br><br>It is hard for me to believe that sixteen years have passed since the first time I held you in my arms? I remember every detail about your birth, and often replay that day in my head – wishing I could go back and relive it one more time.  You know for a fact that even today if I get a chance I would jump at seeing your baby videos over any movie or series on TV. I am incredibly lucky to have been chosen to be your mom. 
      <br><br>I must start by saying that you have grown into an amazing young teen. You are beautiful, confident, smart, and well-liked by everyone. It amazes me to see how people are drawn to you. 
      <br><br>Would like you to know how incredibly proud I am of you. I know I have been hard on you at times. I set high expectations that you sometimes feel are impossible to reach. Let me reassure you that you have never ever disappointed me despite our arguments and fights. To state an example: your Arangetram that you did in Jan this year which you executed flawlessly.  I set those expectations because I know you can and that you will do it. Prachi, I want you to be happy and want all of your greatest dreams to come true. I never want you to feel undeserving of anything, because you deserve the absolute best that life has to offer.
      <br><br>I want you to keep that confidence you had, and continue to try new things and have an open mind.  You never know what door will open if you just put yourself out there. Life is full of ups and downs and you will make mistakes, but it’s okay because that’s how you learn lessons and become a better person. I’ve certainly made my share of them, and still make them even today sometimes. Life is about learning along the way no matter how old one gets. 
      <br><br>Remember to keep moving forward and never let anything drag you down. Never ever lose hope. Reach out for help and don’t be afraid about others judging you or belittling you because you may never know what they may have gone through in their lives too. 
      <br><br>Today on your 16th birthday I wish you strength to face challenges with confidence along with the wisdom to choose your battles carefully. I wish you adventure on your journey and may you always stop to help someone along the way.  You will always be my sweet little baby (my chunnu munnu), your daddy’s little girl and Mythili’s THB. We will all always be here for you – “YOUR BIGGEST FANS”
      <br><br>Love you dearly,
      <br>Mom
