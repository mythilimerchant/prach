      HAPPY SWEET SIXTEEN BIRTHDAYYY PRACHIIIIII !!! 
      <br><br>Finally your 16, I bet you would be the worst driver among all our friends haha. Maga I can’t wait to see you and celebrate your sweet sixteen! You have been and will always be my wonderful best friend. We have created so so so many beautiful memories together, I really miss being on calls with you every day and hear u say “arey haw”!
      <br><br>I hope you will get better quick quick, and things get back to normal, and we can get back your fun mad prachi vibes back. We can change that sad vibes :(  playlist  to happy vibes playlist :)  on your Spotify! You know the last time I made my midnight meals was with you, I really miss making my soups with you. Omggg also we can start those music guessing contests, I heard more songs and became better in music knowledge hehe, and annoy your papa Alexa. Ahhhh we can get back those laughing challenges, I still remember that day when we tried to hold our laugh and lost it and my mom walked in judging us sooo bad, it was the best day! there are sooo many more hilarious incidents I remember, and it’s gonna take me more than a page to fill, you know writing is one big weakness of mine so I’m not going to write instead I’ll express all my bestie love to you when I meet you, hope that would be sometime soon, ugh I hate this stupid lockdown, I cant even meet you, wish all this covid and bakwas vanishes magically and we can finally throw one mega party and have a great blast !! once again I wish you a very birthday, enjoy your day, lead a crazy life ahead. LOVE YOU LOADSS!!
