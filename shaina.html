      Prach,
      <br><br>I've written literally countless letters to you whether it’s your birthday or just random messages when you’re having a bad day, yet I never seem to run out of words. I mean we both write one one letter each at least twice a year and they’re always filled with inside jokes and us telling each other how much we love each other &lt3 Anyways, you’re going to be reading this when you’re 16!! That’s huge! 16 means we can drive a 50cc bike ( so basically a yulu ) on the road rip :( Maybe we can take a yulu to like Goa or smtg and finally go on that vacation which we’ve been planning for literal years. &lt/3 I'm so so glad you randomly decided to show up at my house(?), and that we became friends in like 2nd grade. Actually, I have no idea how we became friends, it’s just always been like this constant thing that Prach is your best friend?? We should seriously ask Rashmi Ma’am, because I feel like she’ll know. I don’t even know what to say here because I feel like everything that needs to be said has already been said between us literally countless times. Honestly, I have no idea how/when/why we became friends but I’m so glad we did because I don’t know who else I would’ve choked countless times on water while laughing about Aadi Dubey with. I don’t know who else I would’ve literally grown up with, because it’s crazy how we’ve been best friends the entire time. I mean we’ve had millions of fights, in which mainly you have been mad at me shhsh, and we always manage to become best friends again. I can’t believe the countless memories we have together, whether it’s Aryan Dixit pew pew pew, DIPSI, Aadi dubey the loml, Pachinko, ASOUE and every single memory which when we think of, we literally can’t stop laughing :D I miss Sugandha Ma’am and her 1,2,3, and halloween with Daksh asking him to take us to his mom &lt3 . And collecting books for DEW dream where we go house to house and we can’t stop laughing when we’re talking to Aunties; when they ask us to come back the next day, some new person opens the door and they don’t even understand what we’re talking about or random people inviting us into their house for pujas and feeding us prasad while we just came to ask for books?? I can’t remember any time where we both meet and don’t go into a laughing fit without one of us choking or peeing their pants. Even Janani Aunty used to get annoyed by how much we used to laugh in French tuition, and call us ‘monkeys’. I hope you’re laughing as much as I am while typing this because I’m barely able to answer in class. Basically, you’re my best friend and I can’t imagine life without you. You’ve always been there for me and always been my number one supporter, whether I’m freaking out over some stupid Science extempore Rejitha ma’am has given me or Abhimanyu is randomly making me cry for no reason. I can’t believe that out of the 16 years you’ve lived so far, you’ve spent 10 of them laughing your ass off with me!
      <br><br>You’re an amazing person who is super duper funny, and always manages to make me laugh. And sorry but you have an unhealthy obsession with taking pics. You mean the world to me and I’m always going to be there for you, even when you’re being dumb about stupid guys. You are a v v cool person and a great great friend, even though sometimes you’re a little extra with the birthday gifts. It’s like the May-August season is just both of us talking about each other’s gifts all the time every single year. Sometimes, I think we are only little stupid actually. You are so so strong, I mean we got into that fight with Arnav in 5th grade and still didn’t even cry. I have no idea what we were thinking tbvh, I think we were thoda mental. We should’ve just called him a madhumakhi and dipped :) I feel like I’ve rambled way too much now, I just want to say I love you with all my heart and I hope you have the bestestest day ever, and that you never ever change. You’re always going to be the Dhinchak Mogambo to my Kancha Circuit (or was it the opposite?? I don’t even remember) 
      <br><br>Lots of love,
      </br>Shine
