      <br><br>Dear Prachi Merchant,  
      <br>(FINALLY using the letter writing techniques schools been teaching us for years)
      <br><br>HI PRACHU! FIRST OF ALL HAPPY BIRTHDAY❤️ HOW IN THE WORLD ARE YOU SIXTEEN?! SWEET SIXTEEN ALREADY?? YOU STILL ACT LIKE A SIX YEAR OLD WITH ALL THAT WHINING AND DRAMA YOU DO🐸 I remember the first day I saw you at school, you looked like one chomu, I mean you still do, a bigger one in fact. Don’t know what sin I did to end up talking with you that day🙄. Jokes apart, IM SO GLAD I DID BECAUSE WE’RE SO CLOSE NOW AND WE’VE HAD SUCH FUN TIMES FOR THE PAST 2YRS, from all those stupid eco classes with Madhuri, where we nicely ate at the back and bullied her to our lame sleepovers. Btw I only spoke to you in eco bcuz of those yummy brownies your mom makes🤤 actually ill come clean, I befriended you only bcuz I heard of your moms brownies.. well it would be even better if they were pot yk😉 hey, brownie points to me for cracking that joke😂😂 meet’s English classes were too funny! Remember when I asked you to bring all those random things- comb, medicine and all and you ACTUALLY got them. You’re my servant, that’s official 😘 also the only person id prank call people with would be YOU. Your only skill that is , being a PHONY (pun intended). OMG im going to really miss the endless hours of past papers we did, shriya, you and I full time on calls going through every past paper there is and both of us dying because shriya is such a SLOW-POKE. 11th also we’ll do but only thode bahut subjects we have in common but that’s fine theres going to be so much more fun things. ill always be there to break your glasses &lt3 after all youre the chi🤢 part of jerchi. I could write some 18pgs just like how you did on my bday which I don’t think ive read still oops but you know my lazy ass plus youll get tired of reading my rubbish😗
      ALSOO last and most important part, I know its been a terrible couple of months for you but everything will be FINE!! Trust me theres nothing you cant face. Youre soo strong, the most hyper and cheerful person i know so PLSPLS get that old Prachi we all know back. Yk what barney says “when Im sad I just stop being sad and be awesome instead” so BE AWESOME. 
      I love youuu, have the bestest day! 
      <br>-Jerry
