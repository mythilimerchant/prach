      To someone I can trust with my life, itâ€™s been over a year since we started talking, and a year ago, I could have never imagined still being in contact with you, and to this extent! From playing PUBG together (even though I was the one playing and you were just standing there), to simply talking, to watching movies, I loved every moment of it. Every single time I talk to you, Iâ€™m reminded of what a warm and passionate person you are (and maybe stubborn also but since Iâ€™m supposed to say nice things, Iâ€™ll steer clear of all this;)) I want you to know that you can tell me absolutely anything and know that itâ€™s gonna be in safe hands.
      <br><br>To one of the strongest people I know, I could only wish to be as secure and headstrong as you. Having gone through so much and still having time to talk to me, will be something I shall never forget. I hope you know how much it means to me, how much YOU mean to me.
      <br><br>To the most genuine and sincere person I know, the true value of your friendship lies in your uncanny ability to change my mood without even trying. The impact you have had on my life is truly infinite and I can safely say that I would not be the same person if it wasnâ€™t for you.
      <br><br>SO HAPPPYY BIRTHDAYY PROCHII!! Youâ€™re finally turning 16, even though itâ€™s like half a year (thatâ€™s like a generation apart) after I turned 16 ðŸ‘€. I want you to have a wonderful day and a brilliant year ahead.
      <br><br>Love you loads.
      <br>Thanayy (that really good-looking friend you have)
