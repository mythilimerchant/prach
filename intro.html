      For your 16th, I (with a lot of help from Dushyanth because I am still learning to code) have made you a website from scratch with some notes from your best friends and family. I hope this helps you realize just how loved you are and how none of us judge you for your rough times, but rather want to be by your side through it all. I hope it helps you realize that you have an entire support system at your disposal 24/7; a whole band of cheerleaders.
