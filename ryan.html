      Happiest birthday to the funniest and most excited person in the WORLD! Prachi, getting to know you has been so amazing and im so happy that we got so close in 2020/21. Early morning walks during MOCKS and shipping samridhi right before the exam and texting at like 2 am has been so much fun with you, Honestly the dumbest person I know but still lysmm. Literally ALL our meetup plans failed either cuz of exams/corona or stupid people who couldn’t come. After lockdown we DEFINITELY have to meet up cuz its long over due sheesh. Soryy for ghosting you BUT YOURE JUST SO ANNOYING HEHE LOVE YOU &lt3. Us being the only 2 excited people in our among us games, and calling at 2 am, mugging up the textbook 20 minutes before the exam and literally every stupid thing we’ve done has been a memory that I will keep w me forever. You mean so so much to me and honestly I hate that youre not in your best shape. Just know that any thing you need, the smallest thing, ill be here. Youre such an enthusiastic and fun person to speak to and its honestly been so terrible that I haven’t been able to speak to you in the last 3 months. I really really hope you start feeling better and get back to your old self, I really really miss you and I hope you get better asap. CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU FEEL BETTER OKAY?? We’re gonna watch riverdale and binge watch some movies and eat comfort food to make you feel better okay?  Anyways you know HOW MUCH I SUCK AT ENGLISH, which is why I should probably shutup now (like you always say). So, happy birthday to the best “partner in crime” I could ask for, I love you so so much Prachi and you mean so much to me. I hope you feel better and please do take care. Im here for you, I love you, and have the best day. (But party without me cool? Okay thanks ly)
