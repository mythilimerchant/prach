      Prachu, my baby, my tiny human being, my best friend, my sister, my whole heart, my everything. 
      <br><br>Fun fact: You used to hate soup so much as a child that Laxmi akka and all of us would have to force feed you soup because you were so fussy. Another fun fact: You love soup today, so much so that you would pick soup over maggi on some days when you were at the hospital. You have always been stubborn and rebellious and quite frankly, ANNOYING. You never listen, you tend to realize things only months or years later (like the soup thing), and are so hard to get sense into more often than not. Plus, I feel like slapping you way too often. But, you are also so talented, extremely hard working, incredibly lovable, the most beautiful girl, a really funny human being and crazy smart. You are all of this and more, and I think about it every day. I remember how I felt after your arangetram on January 9th, my heart was so so happy and so so proud of you. You were confident, beautiful, graceful, and honestly – perfect. You know prach, life is hard - we all often screw up, make mistakes, make poor choices, and lose ourselves every now and then, but how we come out of it and grow from it is what truly matters. If life was always perfect, happy, beautiful – how would we grow as human beings? How would we get stronger? Your arangetram proved to me and the entire world what you are capable of – extreme emotional strength, physical strength, high confidence, resilience, ultimate beauty and the highest form of talent. Be that person more often. Be the person who faces your fears with strength, a confident young woman who knows what she is capable of. Don’t let people mess with you, hurt you, challenge you, and make you feel not good enough. Kill with your beauty and brains, and heal with that love in your heart. I promise you, I swear, hope and faith always wins over giving up. ALWAYS. I am so proud of everything you have accomplished today, of everything that you are, and everything that you will be. I need you to remember that. If times are hard today, it is only temporary. It is always temporary. 
      <br><br>Happy 16th birthday to the only person I ever want to sing along to taylor swift music with, to the only person I want to watch IPL with (sorry, dad), to the only person that is pickier about pictures than me, to the only person I enjoy eating maggi with, to my forever FRIENDS buddy, and the only person that loves piri piri more than me. Happy 16th birthday to my entire world. You know, when I say this, I’m sure you think didu is over-exaggerating. You must be wondering, “Oh, how can I be her whole world? She’s crazy oof shutup”. But, I mean every bit of it. I mean it when I say that you are the single most important being in the world to me and that you always will be. I mean it when I say that there is no one I’d rather have as my sister and that no matter what, I will hold your hand through your entire life and beyond. I mean it when I say that you are my best friend and that I will never let anyone do you wrong and will protect you with my soul and entire being. And I mean it when I say that you are my baby, and always will be no matter how old you grow. But, most of all – I mean it when I say that I will never give up on you, no matter how much you push me away or no matter how hard it gets. That is my promise to you today, and for the rest of our lifetimes because I know we’ll always be sisters in all our lives. You’ll never get rid of me, we’re bound together forever. Prachu, my baby, I love you. I love you so much, way more than you will ever comprehend. 
      <br><br>Love and only love always, 
      <br>Didu
