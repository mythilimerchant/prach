        I need a quick favour, 16 doesn’t seem to add up, just send me a quick copy of your birth certificate to show me a) you’re not actually 9 years old, as I suspect, and b) I’m not going insane. What’s even more insane is that I’m actually writing this - I think it’s fair to say that you’re kind of a beast when it comes to writing out endless birthday paragraphs. It’s definitely not gonna beat that list you sent me, though. The last few months haven’t been all that much fun, to say the least. That being said, I really do think you’re starting to turn a corner. Even in just the last couple of months, you’ve started to open up to people outside that innermost circle, and I personally think it’s doing you a lot of good. It’s awesome to see you start shifting back, and reintegrating yourself with everyone. You’re doing so, so well, and I just know you’re gonna stay on the upswing.
        <br><br>You know about 90% of what I just said anyway, so I’ll make it a little less boring (my specialty, of course). The last 8 months or so have shown me just how much better my life is with you in it.  You’ve had this weird knack of always calming me down when I let work pile up, like on the night before my SATs, the new climate project, or when I was freaking out about all of those presentations. I say weird because it’s so uniquely a Prachi method. You effectively repeat the same thing 90 times in half an hour, with this completely unfounded conviction that probably could get me to believe that Norway’s hiding some flying pigs away from the coasts. I can’t explain how, or why, but it works. You’ve somehow kept it up even of late. It honestly amazes me that you still have room to help me deal with my stuff when your plate is as full as it is now.
        <br><br>Apart from the general stuff you see with friends, in the last year, you’ve pretty much become the one constant I can always come back to at the end of the day. Shit gets hectic all the time, no 2 months of the year are ever the same here. Whether it’s you tolerating my endless complaining and grammar obsessions, practicing my bullshit monologues on you, my array of insults that I refuse to apologize for, or just school stuff, I’ve always been able to come back and ramble on about something. When everything’s constantly up in a whirlwind, and I can’t seem to see what things are gonna be like even 3 months from now, you’ve always been at the eye of the storm. Just the simple constancy of how you deal with stuff calms me down in ways and extents I can barely explain.
        <br><br>All of that horseshit aside, here’s my tasklist for you on the day (since you know I’m obsessed with tangible shit). You’ve never listened to any of my gyaan, so I’ll limit it to 5 directives:
        <br><br>1)	I swear to god, if you do any SAT work, I will personally come with a loaded gun. If even I’m telling you not to work, it’s probably God’s intention for you not to work.
        <br>2)	Watch a NEW movie. Not some crap you’ve seen 5 times in the last month. My Netflix watch list is elite, there’s no debating it, so I can give you 800 options. 
        <br>3)	Get some good shit to eat. Pretty self-explanatory.
        <br>4)	TEST. FINALS. The Kiwis are perfectly nice buggers, but I need moral support in wanting their team in ruins. Educate yourself on test cricket, it’s honestly pathetic that you only watch IPLs. Our friendship depends on it. The 21st is still Day 4, so it’ll be the fun sexy shit when Pant goes off, so it’s a nice transition from this T20 obsession you’ve dug yourself into.
        <br>5)	Do something that makes you happy. Doesn’t matter if it’s talking to some friends, your god-awful Khalid music, whatever. COVID birthdays aren’t exactly a whole lot of fun by default, so actively do anything that helps you relax and just improves your mood.
        <br>I know you’re gonna start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel now, so just give it some faith. I’m pulling out your method, so I’m saying it’s true, and I’ll repeat it as many times as I need to get you to believe it too.
        <br><br>-	Guess who
