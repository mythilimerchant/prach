    I literally cannot fathom the fact that you’re actually 16, mainly because for me, you’ll always be a five-year old at heart. I still remember the day we first met, seven years ago wow. I came back from school and I saw you running in the corridor in your dumb NPS uniform. Little did I know, my life would completely change from that day. Remember how we fought over cricket and other dumb stuff and I made you cry, because I kept beating you. Teacher teacher, airport airport, watching ipl and tvd, studying together, recording songs with Akshara, running and cycling, listening to your rants, starbucks, making fun of vivek, stalking the sisters, prank calling and so so so much more. Prach every moment I spent with you was priceless. I wouldn’t give anything in exchange for those memories. You made me so happy and I can never repay you for bringing me so much joy. You never failed to make me smile even if I was having a really bad day and I love you and appreciate you so much for that. You just radiate pure happiness and enthusiasm to everyone around you and I hope you realize what a huge impact you have on my life. Without you, it would have felt incomplete and dull and I don’t know where I would have been. Thank you so much for teaching me to always look at the bright side of life and for constantly making me feel loved. Thank you for sticking with me throughout, even after we lost touch for a few months. I am so so so glad we became close again during lockdown, because I will always need you Prach, so please don’t ever leave me. I know these past couple of months have been rough for you but I am extremely proud of you, because I know you tried your best and you’re still trying, and one day, I promise, everything is going to be okay. Don’t stress about anything, everyone loves you so much and we’re all here to support you, just keep pushing. You are the strongest, sweetest and most optimistic person I know and I also know I can trust you with absolutely anything. These last seven years have been absolutely amazing with you and I know the future is going to be even better. Please never forget that I am always here for you no matter what and I will always try my best to make you feel happy the way you always make me. Every moment with you is so special for me and I’ll never forget how much fun we’ve had. Anyways happy birthday Prach! I hope you have the best day ever and a great year ahead. I love you so much &lt33
