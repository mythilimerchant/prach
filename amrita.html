        <br>Prachi Merchant. 
        <br><br>Dear Prachi,
        <br><br>I feel like I’ve written you so many cards over the years, long messages, or simply even just talking to you, giving you ‘advice’. I’m running out of words to pen down (NOTE: I NEVER run out of words to say). 
        <br><br>But it feels like this should be a little different, you know? This would not be a birthday card where I would write the number of years you’ve been born, or how annoying you are (even though OH MY GOD YOU’RE LIKE SOOOO ANNOYING). 
        <br><br>You’ve been going through hell Prach, not even a fool would deny it. I can’t even begin to imagine what you must be feeling or what your parents, your sister or Shaina would be feeling. 
        <br><br>But I’m so so so so so proud of how far you’ve come. I remember when you called me that day and it broke my heart (sorry for being so sappy). I got nightmares and shit bro😂. But we’ve been talking and you SEEM so much better I can only hope you’d be feeling better than you were. 
        <br><br>Remember that your weakness today is your strength tomorrow. It’s going to get better,eventually, it always does and I’m so sure you’ll get through this so much stronger and smarter and you'll rule the damn world like the queen you are:). I love you so much,Prachi, you already know that. You’ll always have me to support you and keep you going, even though I get pissed at what you do like all the time. You’ve got this amazing future in front of you that you can pave your way for, structure on your own, it’s all waiting for you. Last year was so much different from this birthday, but tomorrow is going to be better (it’s a metaphor, I don’t literally mean tomorrow). You have purpose, that’s why you’re here. That’s what so many of us keep you going, we care more about you than you could ever know, Prach. Also you gotta keep pushing for the sake of things like, ice cream, movies, shows, crazy,stupid,fun stories, or simply just sunsets and hatred of cats. 
        <br><br>I promised you a Starbucks trip (that you bailed on me), Polar Bear, fries from Happy Endings and hopefully so much more that we can do once everything goes back to normal. And I can’t wait for things to turn for the better! It’s going to be so much sauce ness fun. 
        <br><br>Take a day of bro. You deserve one day to just chill, relax. You got this shit handled and when you do, you can look back at these days, flip the bird and just say “F YOU man”. You got this Prachi. 
        <br><br>Love, Amima.
