      Hi Prachi,
      <br><br>Happy birthday!
      <br><br>I have no idea what to write after this, Believe me, I was considering writing all this in 50 font so it could take up the entire page. But then I realized I do have some stuff to say (albeit not a lot because I’m terrible at this). Well, first of all, I miss you. We all do. From randomly trying to study at 12am, to your texts of “BLEH” and whatever gibberish you type, it’s been too long man. Meeting you in APR, regardless of if its Smoor or the bay, is always a blast (I’m paying next time😊). You on hp is an absolute joke, whether it’s making Maggi at 2am or you trying to keep up with my lengthy and probably tedious football rants. I hope to god you have an actual birthday party so that we can meet and actually have some proper fun. It’s sad how we won’t be in the same school anymore, and can’t do our art department shenanigans and take weird pics. You still need to sign my t-shirt and my poster from the last day of school. But on the upside, I live only 20 minutes away and I’ll gladly run 8 kilometers to meet you on any given day, so we better keep in touch, and there’s no way I’ll let you forget me, I’ll pop into your apartment every two weeks and annoy the hell out of u :). You still mean a LOT to me and ily so I will be waiting eagerly for you to pull through.
      <br><br>I cant wait for you to get better… Please tell me if you want to meet any day!
      <br><br>P.S. I am now a passionate fan of formula 1, so when u are back I will make you watch at least one race with me, and bore the life out of you with annoying details and random outbursts… deal with it😎
      <br><br>Samarth
